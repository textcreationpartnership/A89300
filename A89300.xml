            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Herophilus,</hi> (moſt excellent Doctor) that Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are the hand of God if rightly applyed; but if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by an unskilful and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perical hand, nothing is more prejudicial. Now ſeeing that in all earthly enjoyments no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more deſirable then health, without which the whole Series or length of life is an <pb facs="tcp:112514:5"/>heavy and unſupportable burthen of miſeries depreſſing of the moſt heroick and noblest ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; Therefore there is nothing more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and excellent then thoſe things which do either preſerve the preſent life, or reſtore the ſame anew when brought almoſt to the laſt act on the Theater of Mortality. Thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies which do reſtore or renew nature, whoſe benefits if once diſcerned by the Patient, how can he chuſe but to affirm, that in them he hath found the immediate acting hand of a Deity? Hence is that moſt antient preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Phyſitians, not onely acquired by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and their function, but alſo rendred illuſtrious, and noted by a regal benevolence, and affection, by how much the greater pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, experience, and happy and ſuccesful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications hath equalized them to the God of Nature. This felicity or happy application of Remedies being erected on the foundation of Science, and receiving its riſe from the ſame, is abſolutely neceſſary for a judicious Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian; wherefore having found out the enemies to Nature, induſtriouſly and artificially di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted and compounded Remedies, which lie on derivative or tranſient efficacy and vertue, penetrate the moſt ſecret parts of the body, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling the enemies to Nature from their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, and ſtrong holds, and ſtrengthening the inward parts againſt a ſecond onſet, by <pb facs="tcp:112514:5"/>repreſſing and excluding of their Wiles. Such a Phyſitian is Morellus (if I may ſo ſay without prejudice) or was at the leaſt, as no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding man can ſafely deny, whom for to commend, is out of my ſphere; his genius, learning, indefatiable pen, and excellent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments now above the vein of my pen, as the stellified Heavens, and planetary Orbs are above the meteors, the ſtile, and fruit, and benefit of the ſame ſufficiently ſpeak of him: for a Tree doth not feed without Apples, though it do boaſt with ſpreading branches, and vainly delude with bloſſomes; ſhould I go about to expreſs the ſublimeneſs of the work, the weakneſs of my Genius would fail in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of the ſame; how ſhould I elevate, or exalt its perfection which is apparently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly to all? yet though the confeſſion of two or three, yea all may take place, and teſtifie an undubitable probation, removing all ſcruple, or contradicting that vanity or preſumption which may caſt ſcurrillous aſperſions by an approved teſtimony, I ſhall here make known to the Reader, that this Tract publiſhed and ſent into the world was compiled by the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious and famous man <hi>Peter Morellus,</hi> in the moſt famous and antient <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of <hi>Montpelier,</hi> being firſt privately communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to me, and by me divulged, neither ſhall I acknowledge any other Author but

The Medicinal may be concinnated into divers and convenient forms, either as the deſire of the ſick, which is not always the ſame, or the affections, or Morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical cauſes, or the various conſtitution of the part affected doth require, according to that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher in the laſt book of his Analyticks.

                     <p>SEeing that the whole manner of Compoſition doth depend on the proportion of ſimples, which are eſtimated by Weight, Meaſure, Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and bulk: I ſhall therefore neceſſarily inſiſt on them. Firſt dry things are generally expended by weight; which having divers differences in the Monuments of the Antients, the more uſed are to be followed by our Phyſitians in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions.

                     <p>What Heads are to be obſerved in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of every Medicine. In the Compoſition of every Medicine three things muſt be obſerved. The Form or Compoſition, the Uſe, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. In the Compoſition on the Material part we ſhall obſerve in our preſcriptions quantity, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and order; where generally note that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity muſt be noted in ſingle; and thoſe firſt moſt Appropriate and Efficacious, that in as much as poſſible may be, the party affected may be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to health very ſuddenly.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, They muſt be Safe, that if they do not remedy, they may no wiſe prejudice the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though in deſperate Diſeaſes, deſperate Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines may be uſed with an exquiſite Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:112514:16"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, They muſt be Pleaſant and Jucund, in colour, ſmel, and taſt, yet contrary and reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to the diſeaſe, and in ſo doing, you may happily put a gloſs on nature.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, ſuch Remedies as are experienced and approved; for theſe will more ſafely cure then thoſe which are newly found out by a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, though of the greateſt judgement; for the quantity in a continuity they muſt all be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, not commending the uſe of an ounce when a dram is ſufficient. More ſpecifically, thoſe Medicines which are bitter or nauſeating, neither in taſte or ſmell, not being eaſily retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or taken by the Patient, muſt therefore be compounded in a leſs doſis; for the diſcreete quantity or number of the ingredients, thoſe compoſitions muſt not be uſed where their ſimples are ſufficient. Alſo in the compoſitions of ſimples avoid much a vaſt and high bulk made like a theriacal Medicine; theſe kind of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines cauſing a loathing in the ſick who taketh the ſame, and a trouble to the Apothecary, in compounding or forming of the Paſte on that account, cauſing an omiſſion, depriving the Phyſitian of his hope, and the ſick of the operation of the Medicine, with the loſſe of his health. For the order of the preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though nought of the ſtrength of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine do ſink after what ſort ſoever the Simples are preſcribed, ſo they are rightly prepared, yet it is far better, and more ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly to obſerve ſuch an order in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, as I have deſcribed in every form, ſo that in the general I have nothing more <pb facs="tcp:112514:16"/>worthy of animadverſion in the uſe of the preſcribed form; Firſt conſider the quantity, or doſis, then the time, and laſtly the uſe; hence the words adnected, in which the form is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. In the Utility I ſhall ſhortly and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrate the univerſal fruit which doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merge from the form of every medicine in the Genus and the Species.</p>

<hi>Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> which hath a vertue to alter the body, and things contained in it, eſpecially the Humours, without that viſible evacuation which is uſually called purging.</p>

                           <p>They alter humors either in the firſt or ſecond qualities, and that either without intention of purging, and theſe are called ſimply altering apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zems, as heating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or elſe alſo in the ſecond qualities, and with intention of future purging, and theſe are generally called preparers; or elſe as they have relation to particular humors, they <pb n="3" facs="tcp:112514:18"/>are ſpecially termed preparers of phlegme, Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                           <p>But enough of them; in an altering Apozem theſe three things (as moſt relating to a method of Phyſick) are to be chiefly conſidered, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Compoſition: 2. Uſe or manner of preſcribing. 3. Benefit gained by them.</p>
                           <p>In Compoſition ſix things are diligently to be conſidered.

                           <p>Concerning the quality: the matter or ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, preſcribed in Apozems or other decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are chiefly roots, barks, woods, leaves, ſeeds, fruits, flowers, ſpices.</p>
                           <p>The quantity or Doſe in which the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid things are preſcribed are thus to be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>

                           <p>Fruits are either the leſſer ſort, as Raiſins
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are preſcribed two ſeveral wayes, either in weight, as from one ounce to two ounces, or elſe in number, and that uſually by pairs, as to 4.6.10.20 pair.</p>
                           <p>Or the greater, &amp; then they are preſcribed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in number, either even or odd, if they be of the greateſt ſort, (as Apples ſliced, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) then 1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but if they are leſs, as Figgs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by pairs, a ♃

                           <p>Spices are better added in the ſeaſoning then in the boyling; yet if it ſeem requiſite, in purging Apozems you may preſcribe them from two drams to half an ounce at moſt.</p>
                           <p>Concerning the order of the preſcription: as they are to be prepared by the Apothecary, ſo ought they to be preſcribed by the Phyſitian, <hi>viz:</hi> firſt roots, (then barks and woods, if any be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.) 2 Leaves. 3 Seeds. 4 Fruits. 5. Flowers, and with them the ſpices laſt of all.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Liquor</hi> in which theſe are to be boyled is to be conſidered, either in quality or quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                           <p>In relation to the quality, it is varied according to the intention of the phyſitian; but gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fountain, or the beſt wel water is preſcribed to the decoction of moſt Apozems. Yet oftentimes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112514:19"/>when the intention is to cool and cleanſe (as in cholerick affections) they preſcribe barly water; but if to attenuate, cut, and cleanſe, and heat, as in phlegmatick affections, then the ſmaller ſort of Mead; in Melancholick diſtempers Whey, and ſometimes in obſtructions of the Intrals chalibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated water: and ſometimes the decoctions are preſcribed by Phyſitians to be made in Wine and Water, of each like quantities; but it is better to add wine only in the latter end.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Quantity</hi> of the Liquor is ſeldom preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Phyſitian, onely by q. s. or as much as is ſufficient: yet it vvere to be lookt to, that by adding too much Liquor the things might not be over-boyled, to reduce it to a reaſonable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, or by taking too little, the vertues not ſufficiently extracted <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>DECOCTION: The ingredients being recited, and ordered how to be managed, are preſcribed to be made into a decoction by a <hi>fiat Decoct:</hi> &amp;c. to wit, in the Liquor afore mentioned, which is commonly ſingly ſet down without determining to what quantity the Liquor ought to be waſted; yet uſually it is preſcribed to vvhat quantity it ſhould be conſum'd, as <hi>fiat decoct. &amp;c.</hi> to one pint, or one pint and a half, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> either way is allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo that the Decoction being finiſhed it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to take of the decoction ſtrained, a pint, or a pint and a half, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for Apozems are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended for four Doſes; and if you take one pint and a half, there wil be for every Doſe about 4 ounces and a half more or leſs; but if you intend it for five Doſes, preſcribe 20 ounces and no more, for elſe it is apt to corrupt or mould before it be ſpent.</p>
                           <pb n="6" facs="tcp:112514:20"/>
                           <p>Things to be diſſolved in theſe Decoctions are either to help them to keep the longer, or to give them the better reliſh, or to add ſtrength and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to them; and in all theſe we muſt conſider both quality and quantity.</p>
                           <p>In reſpect of their quality, either it is 1. ſome ſyrup only, and that ſuch as is proper both for the diſeaſe and part affected, and this ſhould always be added, both becauſe it helps to ſweeten the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and imparts its own virtues to it; by which means are alſo helped the defects of the Apozem it ſelf; and other faults which may ariſe, either by the careleſnes, covetouſneſs, or malice of the Apothecary, are much prevented.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Sugar alone in ſome affections, and humors as wel hot as cold.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Syrup and Sugar together.</p>

                           <p n="5">5ly. Beſides theſe ſweetners, one or two of which are alwayes to be mixt with every apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zem, there are oftentimes very commodiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (to make it the more effectual) mixed with them;</p>
                           <p>Either the juyces of divers herbs, according to the ſeveral intentions of the Phyſician: as the juyces of Fumitory and Hops, in Melancholy; of Borage and Bugloſs, if choler be mixed with it; as alſo the juyces of Sorrel or Mercury in divers affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Womb, and ſuppreſſion of the Termes <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                           <p>Note that when juyces or other Liquors are to be diſſolved in your Apozems, then ſugar alone is uſually choſen to ſweeten it, very ſeldom ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups.</p>
                           <p>The quantity of things to be diſſolved dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers according to the nature of them.

                           <p>But where ſyrup and ſugar are mixed together, the quantity of the ſyrup is for the moſt part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three ounces, and the ſugar preſcribed only with a <hi>q.s.</hi> is left to the palate of the Patient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>

                           <head>A purging Apozem.</head>
                           <p>A Purging Apozem which is now moſt in uſe and not unknown of old to <hi>Meſues,</hi> is ſo called becauſe at once it both prepares the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and empties thoſe which are already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, and this at divers times, (<hi>viz:</hi> 4 or 5) ſenſibly, by that operation which is called <hi>Epicra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> by the virtue of thoſe Medicines which are properly called purgers, and is moſt agreeable in long diſeaſes, ariſing from copious and ſtubborn humors.</p>
                           <p>And this Apozem according to the ſeveral na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the humour it is appropriated to, is either <hi>Phlegmagogum, Melanagogum, Cholagogum,</hi> or <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragogum.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In this ſort of Apozems three things are to be conſidered, the <hi>Compoſition,</hi> the <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> and the
<hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In the <hi>Compoſition</hi> two things are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. 1. The ingredients by which it is made purgative. 2. Thoſe things that are to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in it.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>The matter or ingredients</hi> by which it is made purging, are ſimple purgers with their corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives, according to the variety of the humour they are intended for, either boyled together with the matter of the decoction, or boyled in the decoction, or elſe only infuſed in it.</p>
                           <pb n="12" facs="tcp:112514:23"/>
                           <p>In theſe three things are to be regarded the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, quantity, and order of preſcription either for boyling or mixing.</p>
                           <p>In relation to the <hi>Quality</hi> note that thoſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſimples which are only boyled are theſe, <hi>Senna, Polypody, Carthamus, Turbith, Hermodactils, Agarick Epithymum, Hellebor, Spurge, and the ſeeds of dwarf Elder.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But thoſe which uſe only to be infuſed, or very little boyled, are RHEUBARB, <hi>Myrobolans, Tamar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inds, and ſometimes Casſia.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Concerning their <hi>quantity,</hi> they ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in ſuch a proportion that it may ſerve for four or five doſes, but in <hi>general</hi> becauſe the purging vertue by boyling either may vaniſh, or not be ſufficiently extracted, every purging ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ought to be preſcribed in much greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity then otherwiſe, <hi>viz:</hi> double to the quantity they are given in ſubſtance, if they are the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſort; or treble, or quadruple, if they are of the middle ſort of purgers; or a fix-fold proportion in the gentleſt ſort: yet are they ſo to be preſcribed that to two parts of the gentleſt ſort of purgers you muſt add but one part of the ſtrongeſt, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in every purging Apozem let theſe three be preſcribed as the baſis of the decoction in a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful proportion, <hi>viz: Senna, Polipody,</hi> and
<hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus:</hi> let others be added according to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fity of the humor; but in a leſſer proportion, from one ounce to an ounce and half at moſt, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim having regard to the nature of the humor, as alſo its diſtemper, either in firſt or ſecond qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; and laſtly, its quantity, in like manner, to the temper and conſtitution of the body, the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of purging, natural inclination, condition of <pb n="13" facs="tcp:112514:23"/>the country, time of the year, weather, ſex and age, and al other things limiting a Legitimate purging, and to thoſe things that may make eaſie or difficult the ſucceeding purgation; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the ſtronger or weaker purgers are to be given in the greater or leſs quantity.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>More ſpecially</hi> therefore theſe three are to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen for the fundamentals of almoſt every purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Apozem, (for they are convenient in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zems that purge, Phlegm, and Melancholy, and wateriſh humors, and that purge Choler alſo, where Senna is chiefly neceſſary) which things are wont to be preſcribed thus at <hi>Mompelier.</hi>

                           <p>Yet you need not add Turbithor Hermodactils, unleſs you have a purpoſe to purge very ſtrongly, or draw humors from the remoteſt parts; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the two laſt may ſuffice.</p>
                           <p>But if Melancholy be to be emptied (if you wil leave out

                           <p>The uſe and form of preſcription is the ſame with that of the altering Apozem; in this onely it differs, becauſe it is ſaid, Take, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let it be made an Apozem clarified, (or if we deſire it the ſtronger, not clarified) and aromatized, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for four doſes in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in the laſt of which diſſolve <hi>ſome Electuary</hi> (when your intention is to eradicate, or when your Apozem hath not ſufficiently purged) and ſo make it into a potion.</p>

                           <p>It differs alſo, if before the uſe of your Apozem a moderate purge ſhould be given, then is ſaid in the preſcription for four morning doſes, in the firſt and laſt of which diſſolve <hi>ſuch an Electuary, &amp;c.</hi> and make a potion.</p>
                           <p>Touching the <hi>Commodity,</hi> Apozems of late are at once purgers and alterers, for ſo by little they prepare and concoct the humors, which becauſe they cannot at once be wholly eradicated, are thus by parcels, <hi>per epicraſin,</hi> drawn forth without vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence; A happy remedy in laſting Chronical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which are fomented by an abundance of Phlegmatick and Melancholy humors: theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fountain of rebellious and contumacious affections are by this art rooted out; in hot diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes proceeding from fervent humors they are leſs needful; and if at any time they ſeem neceſſary, they are to be compoſed of the gentler ſort of purgers of choler, if it be much; for a ſmal quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of matter needs not a divided evacuation, but being ſimply altered may eaſily be rooted out with one evacuation; they are alſo eſteemed moſt convenient in the declination of diſeaſes, to draw away the Reliques, and in preſervation to prevent diſeaſes.</p>
                           <p>But it is now generally received, that before the uſe of this ſort of Apozems, ſome Minorative Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine may be firſt preſcribed, to diminiſh the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors either in the form of a potion, bole or pils, and afterwards by leiſurely purging in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to prepare them to be wholly eradicated.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Hence this altering Medicine may be judged two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, either it prepares the humors for purgation, as the praepotions of the ancient</hi> Greeks, <hi>which were fore run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning potions of general purgations, which may therfore rightly be called a concocting potion; or elſe alters the humours without any ſcope or intention of purging; as alſo the ſpirits, and other parts of the body: hither ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain a</hi> ſtrengthening <hi>and</hi> Cordial <hi>Julep.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In this three things are to be conſidered, the
<hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,</hi> the <hi>uſe,</hi> and the <hi>benefit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the <hi>Compoſition</hi> two things chiefly are to be weighed. 1. An appropriat Liquor, of which it is to be made. 2. What things are to be <hi>diſſolved</hi> in it.</p>
                        <p>In the <hi>Liquor</hi> two things are to be regarded, the
<hi>quality</hi> and <hi>quantity.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In relation to the Quality, either there is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a ſingle diſtilled water, regarding both the affection, and the affected part, which is moſt frequent (eſpecially in the winter time for the defect of Herbs) either for a <hi>Julep</hi> to prepare the humors, or alter them any other way, or ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the faculties of the body.</p>
                        <p>Or elſe a diſtilled water and a juyce together, which is moſt uſual for a Cordial and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Julep.</p>
                        <p>Or elſe a decoction for ſimple potions to be preſcribed in half the quantity of an Apozem, and almoſt in the ſame manner, which is often to be put in practice, for the concoction and alteration of humors.</p>
                        <p>But the <hi>quantity</hi> for every doſe of Liquor is to be preſcribed to three ounces, or four ounces; ſo that when the Julep is preſcribed for 3 or 4 doſes, the quantity of the Liquor for the whole Julep ſhould be eight ounces, or twelve ounces, if for 3 doſes; to twelve ounces, or ſixteen ounces, for four <pb n="29" facs="tcp:112514:31"/>doſes, having in the interim regard to the age, and growth of the body; for 4 ounces wil hardly be ſufficient for great bodies, unleſs it be powerful in virtue, or ſtrong in taſte.</p>
                        <p>We muſt mark that when diſtilled waters, and Juyces are preſcribed together; ſometimes they are preſcribed in equal quantities; ſometimes the Juyce, ſometimes the water exceeds each other two or three ounces; but you muſt obſerve that when the Juyce that is added is ſowr or ſharp, one ounce, or two ounces will be enough for a Julep of two doſes.</p>
                        <p>Things to be <hi>diſſolved</hi> are conſidered in reſpect of their quality and quantity:</p>
                        <p>A to their <hi>quantity,</hi> either it is ſugar alone which is ſeldom ſeen, or ſome appropriate ſyrup reſpecting both the affection, and part affected, which is generally received every where.</p>
                        <p>Beſides theſe <hi>ſweetners,</hi> ſome other thing is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be diſſolved in a Julep: ſometimes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is diſſolved,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In a preparing Julep, if you preſcribe it of a decoction like apozems the ſame things that are diſſolved in altering Apozems as aforeſaid; for this kinde of Julep is as it were a pretty Apor zem.</p>

                        <p>From hence it is eaſie to find the quantity for a
<hi>Julep</hi> for three or four Doſes: and becauſe <hi>Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> and <hi>Cordial powders</hi> are eſteemed as one thing, if they are preſcribed together, 'tis not difficult to limit the quantities of both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned.</p>
                        <p>And if ſpirit of <hi>Vitriol</hi> be uſed, the doſe is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by ſaying as much as is ſufficient to give it a grateful ſharpneſs (that is which may neither ſmite the Lungs, or ſet the teeth on edge.)</p>
                        <p>The <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>form</hi> of
<hi>preſcribing</hi> is ſet down thus:</p>
                        <p>℞. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (that is, the Liquor and things conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to be diſſolved in it) make a <hi>Julep</hi> for three or four morning doſes, (it may alſo be preſcribed for the evening, eſpecially if it be a <hi>Cordial,</hi> and for one doſe.)</p>
                        <p>But if the Julep be made of a decoction, it is to be preſcribed in the ſame manner as an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zem.</p>
                        <p>If beſides the <hi>Liquor,</hi> and <hi>Syrups</hi> (of which only the more ſimple Juleps both for altering (and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring are uſually compoſed) you ſhal add ſome ſimple or compound ſtrengthening powder to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romatize it; you may ſay, make a Julep which ſhal be aromatized with one dram, or one dram and a half of ſuch a powder, for three or four Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</p>
                        <p>The Juleps of Infants are to be preſcribed, out of a ſpoon twice or thrice a day.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>benefit</hi> and fruit of a Julep is very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as the uſe of themis at this day famous. Firſt, when you deſire to prepare the humors for purging; for by this double form the concoction of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours is perfected, <hi>viz.</hi> of a Julep and Apozem, and is chiefly to be preſcribed in the <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Autumne,</hi> for the ſame end.</p>

                        <p>A <hi>Concocting Julep</hi> is chiefly uſeful for the Winter, and may ſupply the place of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pozem, when not eaſily to be prepared, either through the defect of green herbs, or want of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to keep them dryed; or by the ſcanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time, or urgency of the affection, cannot be made ready neither that nor any other altering Medicine that requires much labour, then an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary Julep may be prepared by the mixture of diſtill'd waters and ſyrups, and ſome fit Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and this way alſo is cheaper for the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſort; ſo that a concocting Julep may be the deputy of an altering Apozem; but although by this means there is a preſent remedy applicable, both ſafe and pleaſant, yet can it not be expected to have the ſame efficacy, for the virtues of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pozem are much more effectual.</p>
                        <p n="2">2ly. When your indications require the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the body, humors, or ſpirits, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of a ſucceeding purgation; but chiefly to extinguiſh any fervent heat of them, or Fevers, or other hot affections, or to bridle the malignity of them.</p>
                        <p>They are uſed chiefly againſt hot diſtempers, to which they are peculiarly dedicated, as alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the heat of the Head and Heart, continual and burning <hi>Fevers,</hi> that are troubleſom by their intolerable heat; as alſo to quench the ardencies of the Liver, Reins, and Bowels, and to quench the thirſt.</p>
                        <p>So alſo is the ardor of the humors reſtrained and if any malignity be joyned with it, it wil be commodiouſly repreſſed by this cooling Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial Liquor; ſo are they uſual to prevent the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the diſeaſe, ſtrengthen the heart, reſtore the <pb n="33" facs="tcp:112514:33"/>ſtrength, confirm the ſpirits and vigour, through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe, and partly to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the affections themſelves.</p>
                        <p>So alſo to reſtrain the motion of the humors, as cruptions of blood, from what part ſoever; as in the beginning of
<hi>Pleuriſies</hi> following the prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous motion of the ſpirits, as in extraordinary watchings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In ſumme, this liquid form is convenient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare humors for purging, to ſtrengthen the heart, reſtore ſtrength ſuddenly, or alterto any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; to perform it ſpeedily when the parts afflicted, either humors or affections, lye deep in the body; to which place alterers in any other form cannot ſo wel be conveighed.</p>

                           <p>When humours in reſpect of their ſcituation are gathered in the firſt region of the body; and are to be expell'd without any perturbation of the body, not to be drawn from far, for in this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid form the purging quality ſoon deſcends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the belly with the Liquor, and is ſoon commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to it, ſo that in ſo ſhort a time the purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quality cannot be diffuſed to the more remote parts, (although ſome ſmal evacuation happen alſo to them by conſecution of the humors) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you boyl or diſſolve ſtronger Medicines, and in a greater quantity, which cannot be done ſo ſafely; in which caſe pils are better, which ſtaying long in the belly, the virtue of them at laſt inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates it ſelf into the habit of the body; therefore a potion is moſt commodious, in affections of the ſtomack, and neighbouring parts, <hi>Pancreas, Meſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Spleen, Liver,</hi> and other inferior parts.</p>
                           <p>But in reſpect of the ſeveral ſorts of humors to be evacuated, the form of a potion (as alſo of a bole) doth more agree with tempers and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are cholerick then the ſolid form of pils; becauſe both to moiſten, lenifie, and cool, (which three properties ſuch a hot and dry conſtitution requires,) thoſe things which are ſuppable and liquid do more aptly perform, and therefore ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be uſed, unleſs a great weakneſs of the ſtomack, and a broken ſtrength (which are more

'tis better to uſe pils or boles.</p>
                           <p>'Tis alſo very profitable to purge Melancholy, becauſe this humor as it were duſty with drought may be waſhed down by ſuch actual moiſture, and the wayes by which it is to paſs made ſlippery, and al other hinderances relaxed and moiſtened; Tis alſo very uſeful in phlegmatick affections, unleſs the ſtomack be very weak, ſo that the plegm be found in the firſt or ſecond region of the body: for if it be in the third Region, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more parts, it wil be little advantagious, unleſs compoſed of the ſtronger and greater quantity of purgers from whence danger.</p>

                           <p>In it three things are to be conſidered, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, the Uſe, and the Utility.</p>
                           <p>In the COMPOSITION four things are to be regarded, the matter or Liquor of which it is made; the things to be diſſolved in it; the clarifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and aromatization.</p>
                           <p>The matter is to be weighed both in <hi>quality,</hi> and

                           <p>The conſideration of the matter is two-fold, <hi>Remote, viz.</hi> the ſeveral parts of ſimples ſpoken of in the Apozem, and
<hi>neer,</hi> which is three-fold, <hi>Decoction, Juyce,</hi> and ſometimes
<hi>infuſion</hi> prepared divers wayes of the aforeſaid ingredients, of which I muſt next treat.</p>

                           <p>And this 3 ſeveral wayes is uſed in the making of a ſyrup.</p>

                           <p>The USE and FORM of preſcribing,</p>
                           <p>In the uſe of a ſyrup either <hi>officinal</hi> or
<hi>Magiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> we muſt conſider three things methodically: after what maner, how much, &amp; when they ought to be preſcribed and given.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. How, or after what manner; that is, whether they are to be given in that ſorm or conſiſtence, that they are of themſelves, or whether diluted with other Liquors, as in Juleps.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. <hi>How much;</hi> that is in what
<hi>quantity,</hi> or doſe.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. When, that is, at what time; neither doth there appear more things neceſſary to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the right and legitimate adminiſtration of them.</p>
                           <p>As to the <hi>manner</hi> of taking them; becauſe a ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup taken by it ſelf, not diluted with any Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, penetrates not ſo far into the body, neither can quickly or eaſily without loſing ſome ſtrength and virtues; and withal works ſlower upon the part affected, and humor that is to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; and on the contrary a ſyrup diluted in the form of a Julep doth ſooner, eaſier, &amp; farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate it ſelf into the parts of the body, &amp; noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humours, (the clammineſs little hindring <pb n="62" facs="tcp:112514:48"/>it,) and can come to the moſt intimate ſpaces with firmer and leſs alter'd virtues, than when it is ſincere, and doth ſooner alter whatſoever it toucheth, ſo that according to the nearneſs and diſtance of the parts affected, the affections them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or cauſes that are to be alter'd, this or that form is chiefly to be uſed.</p>
                           <p>Therefore ſincere ſyrups are preſcribed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly by themſelves, and are taken</p>
                           <p n="1">1. To intercept or ſtop defluxions by thicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from falling violently either on the Throat, Lungs, or ſtomack, for by the help of their clammineſs by reaſon of the ſtay they make in the mouth, and in regard they do not very ſoon paſs down, they eaſily ſtay the humor that is deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and theſe are to be taken out of a ſpoon, and to be held long in the mouth.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. When there is a hoarſneſs of the throat, and a roughneſs of the Wind-pipe, which by its gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle clammineſs (where with it (as it were) ſmears it) it helps, being ſwallowed by little and little, or licked down like lohochs.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. For expectoration, or the ſpitting up of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, collected and impacted in the Lungs, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it by little and little out of a ſpoon, or lick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it down from a Liquorice ſtick.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. To mitigate coughing after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. In diſeaſes and affections of the ſtomack, eſpecially cold ones, (for they which are hot and dry, as in hot and cholerick affections, ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be temper'd by moiſture, unleſs its ſtrength be much decayed) although uſually they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in a ſmal quantity of Liquor (except ſyrup of Wormwood) or when your ſcope be to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en or bind.</p>
                           <pb n="63" facs="tcp:112514:48"/>
                           <p n="6">6. In the affections of parts nigh the ſtomack, to which it may eaſily be conveyed.</p>
                           <p>But diluted or diſſolved ſyrup in the form of a Julep is beſt,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. When the Liver, Spleen, or Meſentory are affected.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. When the head, heart, Lungs, Reins, Bladder, Womb, habit of the body, &amp; Limbs are diſeaſed, to which the virtue of a ſyrup could either not at al, or very ſlowly, and much alter'd from its own nature, otherwiſe have entrance.</p>
                           <p>'Tis to be preſcribed to be diſſolved in a fit, and appropriat Liquor, that may either reſpect the humor, affection, or part affected, or al theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: but moſt uſually in ſome diſtill'd water; or with a proper decoction which is much more effectual than water, or with the broth of a chick, and that either ſimple or alter'd, with Roots, Leaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> agreeing to the ſame purpoſe, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>quantity</hi> is to be conſidered, as ſingular and ſeveral.</p>
                           <p>As to the ſingular or united quantity or doſe, an officinal altering Syrup may be given from half an ounce to an ounce, an ounce and half, and two ounces at the moſt, in defining which doſe more exactly four things are to be diligently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The ſcituation, or diſtance of the part affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, for when the virtue of the ſyrup is to be conveighed to parts far ſcituated and remote, it ought to be given in the greater quantity, yea in the higheſt doſe of all if you ſee it fit; otherwiſe you wil hardly perceive any benefit in the oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, becauſe in a long paſſage its virtues muſt <pb n="64" facs="tcp:112514:49"/>needs be much broken and alter'd; unleſs the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor in which it is diſſolved be alſo very effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The action or motion of the affection it ſelt, and the morbifical cauſes, and the quality of them, either vehement or remiſs, that requires a middle, or elſe the higheſt doſe; this a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The Age: as to Infants half an ounce, which is the leaſt doſe; to Boyes of better growth one ounce, which is next the leaſt, wil ſuffice for the higheſt of al.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. The efficacy of the ſyrup it ſelf, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor it hath naturally to operate; hence 'twil ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to preſcribe
<hi>ſyrup of Poppy,</hi> only from half an ounce to an ounce at higheſt, becauſe of his narco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick quality; ſo alſo unpleaſantneſs ought to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the doſe, as uſually one ounce doth ſuffice for the higheſt doſe of <hi>ſyrup of Wormwood.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="5">5. To theſe may be added the manner of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it; for that which is taken to be ſwallowed down by licking it leiſurely, becauſe they cannot be taken in a large quantity, againſt divers affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Wind-pipe and Lungs, for then it would ſoon ſlip down without doing any good, therefore it is often to be iterated, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes preſcribed to four ounces, or 5, or 6, for fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe to be often repeated; ſo that ſuch ought not to be included within the aforeſaid rule; the ſame is to be ſaid for ſuch as are preſcribed to quench thirſt in the heat of diſeaſes, becauſe the uſe of them is to be frequent, for which purpoſe they are preſcribed to four ounces, five, or ſix.</p>

                           <p>In it three things are to be conſidered; Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſition, Uſe, and Utility.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. The matter whereby 'tis made purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>

                           <p n="4">4. Aroma ization.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>matter</hi> of which 'tis made, is either
<hi>remote,</hi> and this in regard of its <hi>quality,</hi> are the purging ſimples with their correctives, either boyled or inſuſed; or
<hi>neer,</hi> and thus the matter is two-ſold, either a purging decoction, or a purging in uſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                           <p>A <hi>purging Decoction</hi> is nothing elſe then the decoction of a purging Apozem, made of the ſame things, both alterers and purgers, varied ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the intention of the Phyſitian, to be preſcribed after the ſame manner and order, and upon the ſame conditions, as is before ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                           <p>This only is to be marked, concerning the doſe or purging Medicines, that the <hi>Montpelier</hi> Phyſitians for a ſyrup do uſually double the quantities of purgers preſcribed for Apozems; but 'twil ſuffice if you take onely the ſame quantity; or if I might perſwade you, the double quantity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           <p>It is alſo to be noted, that when fit juyces are to be uſed, the purgers may be boyled in 4 ounces, or 5, or 6, with their correctors.</p>
                           <pb n="70" facs="tcp:112514:52"/>
                           <p>How a <hi>purging infuſion</hi> is to be prepared, is ſaid before in a purging potion, and from thence eaſie to be collected; but how to prefer'd before a deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſee in the animadverſions.</p>
                           <p>Things that are to be diſſolved in the decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or infuſion, are alſo conſidered in <hi>quality</hi> and
<hi>quantity.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Concerning the <hi>quality,</hi> there is diſſolved either ſugar, or ſometimes Honey; or elſe together with the ſugar ſome officinal ſyrup, and that either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering or purging.</p>
                           <p>Beſides thoſe ſweetners that are perpetually diſſolved for its preſervation, there are frequently to the aforeſaid purpoſe diſſolved,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Some fit Juyce, and that either altering, as of Leaves, Fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the indication; ſee in the Apozem; or purging, as the <hi>juyce of Roſes,</hi> eſpecially in the Spring time, againſt cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; of <hi>Fumitory</hi> or <hi>Hops</hi> for Melancholy.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The compleat infuſion of Damask Roſes, eſpecially in the ſpring time, when 'tis to be had, and moſt effectual.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Sometimes the infuſion of <hi>Rheubarb</hi> (if the indication require it) made by it ſelf, and added at the latter end; otherwiſe ſhould it be added in the beginning before the ſyrup come to a conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, its virtue may exhale by long boyling.</p>
                           <p>In an infuſion the ſame thing is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, except concerning the aforeſaid Juyces, which 'tis beſt to preſcribe in the beginning.</p>
                           <p>In relation to the quantity, ſugar or Honey are to be added in the ſame quantity with the ſtrained Liquor, which for the moſt part is to be preſcribed to a pound, or a pound and a half; this one thing is alſo to be obſerved, that the quantity <pb n="71" facs="tcp:112514:52"/>of ſugar or Honey is exactly to be ſet down, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that cuſtom which Phyſitians vulgarly uſe) and not to be left to the pleaſure of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaryes; otherwiſe you can never be certain of the exact doſe, which is one, where there is but a little ſugar; another, where there is much. This makes practicers ſtammer when a doſe of a purge preſcribed by themſelves is to be defined: then they admoniſh you to begin with a leſs doſe, ſo proceeding til you have found the true quantity without error.</p>
                           <p>If a Syrup be added, 'tis for the moſt part to 5, ſix, or eight ounces: and becauſe this is accounted of as ſugar, 'twil be eaſie to finde out the right quantity, making an abatement for the quantity of ſyrup: but it matters not whether it be altering or purging, ſo that you uſe this way to find out its right proportion in your computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                           <p>Juyces may be added to ſix ounces or eight ounces; only be mindful of the purgers in appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the doſe.</p>
                           <p>See CLARIFICATION and AROMATIZATION be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Apozem.</p>
                           <p>The USE and form of PRESCRIBING: in the uſe of a purging ſyrup whether officinal or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial, three things ſhould be briefly conſidered; <hi>how</hi> 'tis to be preſcribed and ought to be given,
<hi>in what quantity, and at what time.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>As to the manner of giving an officinal ſyrup, 'tis either by it ſelf out of a ſpoon, or elſe diluted: the former way is rare; for every one of them uſe to be diſſolved, and that in a fit Liquor, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
                           <pb n="72" facs="tcp:112514:53"/>
                           <p>As to the doſe, in general, this may be appointed,
<hi>viz.</hi> from one ounce, to two ounces, three ounces, and four ounces, which is to be the higheſt; yet <hi>ſyrup of Fumitory</hi> and <hi>de Epithymo</hi> may be given to five ounces, or ſix ounces; in the mean time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring other circumſtances, which <hi>I</hi> have ſaid ſhould limit the doſe of purgers in the purging Apozem.</p>
                           <p>The time of giving it is the ſame as of other purgers,
<hi>viz.</hi> in the morning, the ſtomack being empty, leſt the virtue of them ſhould be dull'd, or their operation by the meat or <hi>chile</hi> be much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded.</p>
                           <p>The magiſterial ſyrup <hi>(as to the manner)</hi> is uſed either by it ſelf, out of a ſpoon, or (which is moſt uſual) diſſolved in ſome fit liquor, as above.</p>
                           <p>As to <hi>the quantity,</hi> and that the continued, or u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, they uſually but very ill define it from two ounces to three ounces: they may truly look into the quantity of the Catharticks, but 'tis but curſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily; and perhaps in the mean time are ignorant of what quantity of ſugar the Apothecary hath made it up with al; hence is it that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain concerning the doſe; <hi>I</hi> for my part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it may be half an ounce, an ounce, an ounce and half, two ounces, three ounces, 5, 6, according as the Liquor with which the ſugar is boyled into a ſyrup, is impregnated with the more copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or violent purgers but thus it is, the doſes of the purging decoctions, infuſions, things diſſolved,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are to be accounted, for how many times they may ſerve to purge withal, conſidering them all together. As for example, ſuppoſe them to ſuffice for eight times, and to one pound of Liquor; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with the virtues of thoſe purgers you <pb n="73" facs="tcp:112514:53"/>may add one pound of pure Sugar, and boyl it to a Syrup. If you ſhal divide thoſe twelve ounces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eight parts, (for there are eight purging doſes) there wil be an ounce and half for one doſe: and if you add only eight ounces of ſugar to make it to a ſyrup, there wil be one ounce more for every doſe: <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>As to the divided quantity, it is uſualy given once or twice a monethin chronical diſeaſes; and ſo that filth that is uſually gathered is gently ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, that it cannot arrive at a quantity ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to breed a diſeaſe.</p>
                           <p>But the time of taking it is fitteſt in the morning, as before.</p>
                           <p>The UTILITY is great in chronical diſeaſes, in which there is need of a continual precaution, or a gentle evacuation to be frequently renewed; leſt otherwiſe, excrementitious humours that are apt to breed divers affections ſhould be heaped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in ſuch diſtemper'd bodies, and ill-affected bowels, which are by this means oppoſed; and an occaſion of future affections quite taken away.</p>

<hi>ſo that the Liquor is more than the ſugar by a third part: in other places he preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes the Liquor to double the quantity of Sugar:</hi> as in Syrup de Ponnis Sabor; <hi>ſometimes to <pb n="74" facs="tcp:112514:54"/>treble it, as</hi> in the ſyrup of ſowr Prunes, <hi>and that which is moſt wonderful, ſometimes to be ſix times more then the ſugar, as in the ſowr ſyrup of</hi> Quinces: <hi>ſometimes that the ſugar ſhould double the Liquor, ſo that to ſix ounces of Liquor, he preſcribes one pound of ſugar; ſometimes to eight ounces of Liquor twelve ounces of ſugar; ſometimes he preſcribes a like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Liquor and ſugar; but moſt commonly</hi> Meſues <hi>preſcribes in hot ſyrups both of Sugar and Liquor, a like quantities, or a little more or leſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                              <hi>Modern Writers do much wrangle among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: ſometimes they appoint according to the rule of Syrups a like proportion both of Sugar and liquor, ſometimes more of the Sugar, or more of the Liquor,</hi> Silvius, Fernelius, Joubertus, <hi>and</hi> Rondeletius, <hi>chief Writers of this Art, preſcribe ſeveral quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>

                              <hi>In ſyrups made of infuſions they every where put off the infuſion and ſugar, and; but in ſyrups made of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions, ſometimes of each alike, or (as it is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly) they let the Liquor exceed the ſugar by one third.</hi>

                              <hi>The thing ſeems indifferent to me, onely the nature of the ſyrup is ſomewhat more exactly to be weighed; in which two things are chiefly to be conſidered.</hi> viz: 1. <hi>The ſugar (or ſometimes Honey) which is only as the ſubject to receive the eſſence of the ſimples, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their virtues.</hi> 2. <hi>That virtue or eſſence, conſiſting in the Juyce, Infuſion, or Decoction, from whence the <pb n="75" facs="tcp:112514:54"/>ſyrup hath his force or energie, as the conſervation of that eſſence from the ſugar; the ſyrup being compoſed by the union of both, through the evaporation of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous humidity.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Now every one knows that if you diſſolve one pound of Sugar in any quantity of Liquor, it may eaſily be boyled to the conſiſtence of a ſyrup; that is alſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and approved to them that know the making of extracts, that the Liquor in which the eſſence was dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, and with which it was drawn forth (which is correſpondent to the Juyces,) whether it be</hi> 2, 3, 6, <hi>or</hi> 8 <hi>pound,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>may be wholly evaporated, ſet in</hi> Balneo, <hi>or over aſhes, the eſſence by little and little taking what conſiſtence you wil either of a ſyrup, or ſome ſolid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er form; why therefore need they trouble themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the proportion of either in vain, ſeeing they may reduce any of the aforeſaid proportions to the form of a ſyrup: for if the things compounding the ſyrup:</hi> (viz: <hi>Sugar, Juyces, Decoctions, Infuſions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>whatſoever be their quantity) can be boyled to that ordinary conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by conſuming the watriſh parts, what matter is it in what quantity they are joyned. If</hi> Joubertus <hi>and</hi> Silvius
<hi>boyl three pound of Liquor with one pound of Sugar to the height of a ſyrup; why may it not be done with the like proportion of your Medicinal liquor, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Juyce, Infuſion, or Decoction; and on the contrary, if to three pound of Sugar you add only</hi> 1 <hi>pound of the Liquor,</hi> as Rondeletius in his Syrup of Limons, <hi>why may not this be done alſo; therefore in appointing the quantity of ſugar for a ſyrup, we muſt not ſo much regard the quantity as the force of it, and intention or purpoſe of the Phyſitian;</hi> as for example: <hi>ſuppoſe that one pound of ſimples decocted or infuſed have imparted three ounces or four ounces
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:112514:55"/>of virtuous eſſence to four pound, or five of the Liquor of the decoction or infuſion ſtrained, if you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe of that Liquor and Sugar, and, one pound, as we uſally do for a ſyrup, 'twil truly make a ſyrup, but of l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Laſtly, what weight of Liquor ſoever you boyl it in, whether a pound, two pound, or three, &amp;c. this is to be chiefly marked, (that you may be the more certain of the efficacy of your ſyrup, and may preſcribe it weaker or ſtronger as ſhall be for your purpoſe) that you ſhould ſee, to the virtues and efficacy of it rather then to the quantity of Liquor you preſcribe; therefore 'tis beſt to follow the common rule, where they uſually preſcribe the Liquor and Sugar in equal parts, that you may have ſome knowledg of its operation.</hi>

                        <p>And although Medicines which perform either of theſe may in general be called purgers, yet particularly they are counted ſo which draw forth the excrements of the body by ſtool and vomiting: and of theſe thoſe which by ſtool evacuate, are ſignificantly called purgers; thoſe which expel things upwards, Vomito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                        <p>A Vomitory is not ſo much a name of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid form of a Medicine as of the faculty of it, taking its name from the operation; yet it uſually ſignifies both, <hi>viz.</hi> the Medicine procuring that motion or evacuation of the humors upwards, and alſo the form in which it is preſcribed; of which my intention is here to write.</p>
                        <p>A VOMITORY therefore is a liquid form of a remedy prepared of a ſimple emeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <pb n="78" facs="tcp:112514:56"/>Medicine, boyled, infuſed, or diſſolved in ſome Liquor, evacuating &amp; expelling perforce by the mouth any thing hurtful to the Stomack, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie, either of meat, or excrementitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors from it and the adjacent parts.</p>
                        <p>This from its effect may be ſaid three-fold, evacuating, revelling, and deriving.</p>
                        <p>But from the manner of working one may be termed
<hi>gentle,</hi> correſpondent to the mollifying and lenitive purger, working more by its quantity; another <hi>moderate,</hi> which operates by its quality; another <hi>violent,</hi> anſwerable to thoſe purgers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called Catharticks, provoking this motion by a ſpecifical and internal virtue.</p>
                        <p>Vomitoryes are ſimple, or compound.</p>
                        <p>The more SIMPLE conſiſts of fair water war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, drank ſuddenly to a pint or better; warmed Barley water in a good quantity; the fat broth of fleſh drank plentifully, Mead plentifully taken, which
<hi>Galen</hi> preſcribed; any ſore of drink drank ſuddenly and liberally; <hi>Hydraeleum, i. e.</hi> water and oyl, to eight ounces or ten, common oyl to four ounces or ſix drank warm, and melted but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p>The which and ſuch like other gentle vomits (improperly ſo called) we uſe chiefly, when thoſe things that are to be voided this way, (whether things taken down, or divers ſorts of impurities, and vitious humours contained in the ſtomack,) are ſo ready for evacuation, that upon every little occaſion, without much trouble they may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd whether nature be inclin'd to it or not, or whether ſhe ſtrive to ſhake off ſuch a burthen nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly enough or not, or be not ſufficient of her ſelf, then with theſe gentler ſort do we give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <pb n="79" facs="tcp:112514:56"/>of ſuch a motion to the excretive faculty, if it be dul, and as it were ſhew her the way: or elſe if ſhe moves but unperfectly, we render her endeavour the more eaſie by theſe means; which we often do alſo (without giving a vomit) by thruſting the finger down the throat, or a feather dipt in oyl. But thoſe which work only by their quantity, and move the excretive faculty by their warm moiſture &amp; fatneſs, are not profitable when that that is to be vomited up, either is not in the ſtomack, but in the adjacent parts; or elſe are contained in the more remote parts; or if in it, are fixed in the tunicles of it; or are not prepared; ſo that they cannot be ſhaken out without a greater and more violent motion; for then 'tis better to uſe the compounds.</p>
                        <p>In the COMPOUND Vomitory two things are to be conſidered,
1. The <hi>matter</hi> of which 'tis made. 2. <hi>The things to be diſſolved</hi> in it.</p>
                        <p>The MATTER of a Vomitory is two-fold, <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid</hi> and

                        <p>That Liquor which doth provoke vomit is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a

                        </p>
                        <p>As to the VOMITING DECOCTION, in it three things are to be regarded 1. <hi>The matter</hi> or <hi>ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents</hi> whereby it becomes a vomitory. 2. <hi>The Liquor</hi> in which theſe things are boyled.</p>
                        <p>In either of theſe we muſt ſee to the quality and quantity.</p>
                        <pb n="80" facs="tcp:112514:57"/>
                        <p>The matter or ingredients, as to their quality are diverſe parts of vomitive ſimples, and thoſe moderate (for the ſtrongeſt ſort ſeldom are put into decoctions) as <hi>Roots, Barks, Leaves,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Seeds and Flowers, of which 2, 3, or four ſhould be preſcribed together.</p>
                        <p>As to their <hi>quantity,</hi> thoſe moderate vomitories are preſcribed almoſt as thoſe of Potions, that is, that they make in all one ounce, two ounces, or three ounces at moſt; but particularly, if one or 2 of theſe following be added with others, or ſhould be preſcribed of themſelves, it ſhould uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be in theſe following doſes.</p>
                        <p>The root of <hi>Aſarum</hi> to one dram, two drams, or three drams.</p>
                        <p>The middle Bark of a <hi>Walnut-Tree,</hi> to 1 dram, or two drams.</p>
                        <p>The roots of <hi>Pompions</hi> dryed to two drams, and half an ounce.</p>
                        <p>The flowers of <hi>Broom</hi> to two drams, or three drams, or ſo many pugils.</p>
                        <p>As to the <hi>quality</hi> of the <hi>Liquor</hi> in which they are boyled, you may take very commodiouſly <hi>fair water,</hi> or (where the humors are alſo to be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the ſtomack) <hi>Barly water,</hi> or ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction (where they be dry, ſharp, and hot,) or Mead, (where groſs clammy humors are to be attenuated, cut, and cleanſed;) or <hi>Oxymel</hi> made with water in either caſe, or fat and lenifying broth where the acrimony is to be temper'd, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be of the humors-or poyſons taken, or of ſharp violent vomits, ſo alſo water and oyl in the aforeſaid caſe; which are therefore chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, becauſe they are reckoned among the gentler vomitories.</p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:112514:57"/>
                        <p>The <hi>quantity</hi> of the liquor is uſually let to the judgment of the Apothecary; yet you may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it having regard to what is ſaid before in the Apozem and potion; only obſerve, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe for the moſt part they take eight ounces of Liquor for a vomiting potion, thoſe moderate vomitories ſhould be preſcribed to double the quantity.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>Vomiting Infuſion</hi> in relation to the
<hi>quality</hi> of the things to be infuſed is moſt commonly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared of the ſtrongeſt ſort of vomitories, which are more rightly infuſed then given in ſubſtance or decoction; as thoſe two moſt famous for their vehemency in working, <hi>white Hellebor</hi> of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and
<hi>Antimony</hi> of modern practicers; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though to the ſame purpoſe we may take alſo the moderate vomitories, as <hi>Aſarum, Radiſhes, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion roots dryed,</hi> the middle bark of <hi>Walnuts, &amp;c.</hi> yet becauſe there cometh no danger from them, either given inſubſtance, or decoction, they are to be preſcribed onely in decoction; but in theſe ſtronger 'tis better only to give the infuſion, which communicates onely its ſpiritual virtue without any quantity of the ſubſtance, which might make the operation laſt the longer, or irritate the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive faculty too much.</p>
                        <p>Therefore two things chiefly ſerve to prepare an infuſion of <hi>white Hellebor</hi> of old moſt famous, not only in rebellious and deſperate affections, but alſo in the ſleighter ſort; but now ſcarcely uſed in the greateſt, and then with caution, which being prudently had, you may infuſe it from half a dram to one dram, and a dram and half in broth, adding withal one ſcruple of Cordials for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors.</p>
                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:112514:58"/>
                        <p>In the place of this you may give an Apple made hollow a little, then filled with the root of white <hi>Hellebore</hi> and roaſted; afterwards the <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor</hi> being taken out give it to eat. So alſo the root of a Radiſh ſtuck thorow with ſlices of it, then roaſted and eaten.</p>
                        <p>But in the place of <hi>Hellebor</hi> (as it is now gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally uſed) take <hi>Antimony,</hi> the other growing out of date; neither let it trouble you that it hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been rejected by the unexperienc'd; for 'tis far ſafer than the other, and finiſheth its operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without any manner of ſuffocation, convulſion, or danger of other vehement ſymptomes: to the ſame purpoſe ſome uſe <hi>Antimony crude,</hi> ſome its <hi>Vitrum,</hi> and ſome the <hi>regulas</hi> of it: but 'tis better to chuſe that preparation of <hi>Antimony</hi> which they cal
<hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> becauſe ſo prepared 'tis ſpoiled of its fetid ſulfur, which otherwiſe may be the cauſe of great ſymptoms.</p>
                        <p>To the ſame end take <hi>Antimony</hi> ſo prepared, to 1 ſcruple, or half a dram; or rather half a ſcruple, or <hi>gr.</hi> 12 infuſe it in three ounces, or 4 ounces of white Wine over hot embers, ſtrain the liquor tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a brown paper, and give it.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>In all theſe we muſt conſider both the
<hi>quality</hi> and <hi>quantity.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The WINE in reſpect of its quality is either new and uncleanſed, which is otherwiſe called Muſt, which is much commended for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, becauſe by the protection of its colour, and working heat, the colour and taſte of the ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents are the better obſcured; or elſe
<hi>Wine</hi> cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the lees, and kept for uſe, either red or white.</p>
                           <p>But in relation to the <hi>quantity,</hi> this in
<hi>general</hi> is limited by the uſe and doſe; as, if the uſe be to continue long or ſhort time, or the doſe to be a larger or a Ieſs quantity; as thus, it may exceed the things that are to be infuſed, eight, ſix, four, or three times their weighty but thoſe which add 12 times their weight do it in favour to them that love bibbing, perhaps not with reſpect to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. And it wil be alwaies beſt to let the doſe for a purging Wine be as little as you can in quantity, that it may be the leſs, and more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable.</p>
                           <p>But in ſpecial, they uſually define the quantity of Wine and things to be infuſed in it, thus; A purging Wine that is to be preſcribed is to be uſed twelve dayes, either together, or every other day; in which you muſt be ſure to have twelve ſeveral doſes of the purgers with their correctors, and if it

                              </gap>e needful fit alterers; then muſt you compute the quantity of them all, as for example, ſuppoſe them 8 ounces, now if you <pb n="96" facs="tcp:112514:65"/>would have the doſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap> the Wine to be about an ounce and a half, or two ounces, preſcribe it to 3 times their weight; and ſo for other quantities as you pleaſe; by the ſame way and reaſons you may proceed as you ſee fit: but if the Wine be purely purging, made of the gentler ſort of Catharticks, 'tis to be taken four, five, or ſix times, allowing requiſite internals, as in the magiſterial ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups.</p>
                           <p>The things to be <hi>infuſed</hi> in reſpect of their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, are 1. either purgers onely, with their corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, (among which
<hi>Cinnamom</hi> is chiefly uſed for pleaſantneſs of the ſpice; as alſo <hi>Calamus Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus</hi> of the ſhops for its fragrant ſmel) either one or more: and theſe are to be choſen ſuch as are not of a very ſtrange and unpleaſant taſte; ſuch are <hi>Senna, Polipody, Epithymum, black Hellebor,</hi> (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for Melancholy perſons) <hi>Carthamus, Turbith, Hermodactils,</hi> (for the phlegmatick) <hi>Scammony, Caſſia,</hi> and <hi>Manna ſometimes,</hi> (for the cholerick and ſweet palated, though ſeldom) <hi>Me choacan,</hi> and the ſeeds of <hi>dwarf Elder,</hi> (for purging ſerous humors;) of the which Wines may be prepared to purge any humors; either of ſome of theſe ſingle, or (for the mixture of humors, and complication of intent i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) of divers joyned together.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Or elſe with them are alſo infuſed divers alterers dryed, as Woods, Roots, Barks, Leaves, Seeds, Flowers, ſpices either fewer or more, ſuch as reſpect the humor, or part, whereby the wind is rendred more familiar to it, and generally the Germans (becauſe they are pleaſed with it) mix wormwood with it.</p>
                           <p>In relation to the quantity (whether it be a ſimple purging Wine, or made of more things) <pb n="97" facs="tcp:112514:65"/>the number of doſes for which the wine is prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhal direct you, as for example: a Wine of
<hi>Senna</hi> is deſired for twenty doſes; now the doſe of
<hi>Senna</hi> an infuſion is half an ounce, or ſix drams; therefore ten ounces or fifteen of it is to be preſcribed, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding correctors in the proportion aforeſaid.</p>
                           <p>If the Wine be prepared of many purgers both gentle and ſtrong, and alſo alterers joyned with them; this proportion is for the moſt part to be generally obſerved.</p>
                           <p>Of the gentle ſort of purgers let there be one part.</p>
                           <p>Of the ſtronger ſort, a quarter ſo much as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it is (though you may add them to a third part or to half, it matters not ſo you finde out the right doſe of the Wine,) of Correctors, a quarter ſo much as of purgers, or elſe to a third part, if the purgers are the ſtrongeſt ſort.</p>
                           <p>Alterers ſhould be half ſo much as the purgers, or a third part (if very effectual, as dryed Roots, Seeds, and Spices eſpecially) marking this, that dryed Leaves are to be preſcribed by handfuls, ounces, and drams; And flowers by pugils, and ounces alſo, and drams.</p>
                           <p>THINGS that are to be DISSOLVED, in reſpect of their quality (if perhaps the taſte or ſmel doth not pleaſe the curious palated) are <hi>Sugar,</hi> ſome certain ſpices, eſpecially
<hi>Cinnamom,</hi> which are caſt into the Wine (if it be much;) or if a ſmal quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, they are put into a <hi>Hypocras</hi> bag g, and the Wine often poured thorow them, and is made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a purging Hypocras.</p>
                           <p>As to their <hi>quantity:</hi> for every pound of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Wine you may add 3 ounces, or 4 ounces of <hi>Sugar,</hi> and two drams of
<hi>Cinnamom;</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zems, <pb n="98" facs="tcp:112514:66"/>Juleps. Hypocraſs,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are wont to be made and aromatized.</p>
                           <p>As to the USE: in it two things are chiefly to be conſidered, how much, and when.</p>
                           <p>As to the quantity or doſe of Wine to be drank which is not alwayes one but divers, and which (of whatſoever quantity of purgers or Wine you compoſe your Wine withal) you ſhal thus find out, and exactly define.</p>
                           <p>Meaſure your Medicinal Wine when you ſtrain it, and ſhift the veſſels, and by the meaſure collect the weight; or elſe by ſome other means; And (as for example) ſuppoſe it to be three pound, and this was made purgative with four ounces of <hi>Senna,</hi> two ounces of
<hi>Polypody:</hi> of <hi>Epithymum</hi> and <hi>black Hellebor</hi> of each an ounce and a half, there being one ounce, or an ounce and half of corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors alſo added over and above; Now becauſe all theſe infuſed ſuffice for ſeventeen doſes, they are alſo ſufficient for ſeventeen times; then if you divide it into ſo many doſes, you may find it out without error, and the true doſe of it wil be two ounces, if you would purge ſtrongly, for once; but if you would purge often and gently for ſome dayes together, half that doſe wil ſuffice.</p>
                           <p>As to the time when; becauſe a Medicinal Wine is uſually deſtined for tedious, ſtubborn, and eſpecially cold affections, (ſuch as many are that have had continuance from dreggy mucilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous humors) whoſe cauſes cannot ſuddenly, but muſt by little and little be taken away; therefore the uſe of it is to be continued for divers dayes (eſpecially in the winter time, to 10, 15, or 20 together, or every other day, like the uſual pils; ſo may this alſo be drank in the morning, or two <pb n="99" facs="tcp:112514:66"/>hours before dinner: but if it be not intended for this kinde of purging (which is called <hi>Epicraſis,</hi>) but that you would give it for once to work ſtrongly; the uſe of it wil be the ſame as of your other eradicators in the morning, when the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of purging ſhall require; or if it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed inſtead of your purging magiſterial ſyrup the uſe is the ſame with that once or twice in a moneth, in the morning like other purgers.</p>
                           <p>The FORM of <hi>Preſcribing</hi> may eaſily appear from the manner of compounding it.</p>
                           <p>The UTILITY: as to the benefit ariſing from this form, whether you look upon the virtues of the ſimples infuſed that are to be extracted, &amp; which the Wine doth copioufly attract to it ſelf, or the conveighing them into the moſt intimate parts of the body, by the help of its piercing ſpirit: or whether you conſider the familiarity of it with our nature; which makes it be friendly received by her; or its formal eſſence, what affinity it hath by its very ſubſtance with the radical moiſture, heat, and ſpirit of the ſolid parts of our body, for which cauſe it eaſily is converted into them, and united with them, carrying with it the virtues of thoſe ſimples ſteeped in it, <hi>I</hi> ſay conſidering all theſe, it cannot but be to our great benefit: ſo that whether it be to purge, and ſeperate the dreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy humors, confuſed with the reſt of the humours, ſpirits, and ſolid parts, it can do it perfectly, by the familiarity it hath with our nature, whereby it may inſinuate it ſelf, and the virtues it is imbued withal; or whether it be to alter divers wayes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to cleanſe away the relicks of the foregoing impurities, or reſtore the natural vigour by appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priat means, or to ſtrengthen the parts: either of <pb n="100" facs="tcp:112514:67"/>theſe are this way effectually performed through the ſympathy it hath with nature, and is united to it, together with the Medicinal virtues it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with it.</p>
                           <p>But though the benefit of Medicinal VVine be ſo great, yet 'tis not ſo frequently uſed in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, nor at all times of the year; but is moſt u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual with them that inhabit cold Countries, and chiefly in the Winter, Spring, and Autumn.</p>
                           <p>In general, 'tis good in a cold time of the year, a cold Country, and cold temper of the body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is ſpecially profitable in chronical affections, &amp; a cold time of the year for delicate palated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and is preſcribed againſt paleneſs of colour, difficulty of breathing, confirmed obſtructions of the bowels; and for them that are alſo paralytical, though VVine be forbidden to them, (in which reſpect wine made of Honey would be much better) in affections of the ſtomack, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ariſing from crude cold humors, VVorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood-wine made purging would be excellent.</p>

                           <p>In all theſe the quality and quantity are to be conſidered.</p>
                           <p>The MATTER in relation to its <hi>quality</hi> are both fruits, as Almonds, viz: the ſweet, blanched, and alſo ſeeds,

                           <p>To theſe are ſometimes added both fruits, as the kernels of pine nuts in affections of the breaſt, or where we would moyſten, and alſo reſtore, as in Hectick; and alſo ſeeds, as uſually of white pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, Lettuce, and Purſlane, when we would either-provoke ſleep, or cool more effectually, or thicken thin &amp; hot humors, and temper their acrimony.</p>
                           <p>In reſpect of their quantity, both fruits and ſeeds are in general preſcribed from one ounce to three ounces, but in ſpecial, there may be of fruits, an ounce and half or two ounces; of ſeeds, one ounce, or an ounce and half.</p>
                           <p>The LIQUOR with which this milky ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is drawn forth, in relation to his quality is either fair water, or ſome ſimple diſtill'd wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; or uſually the decoction of whole Barley, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially where we deſire to cleanſe; or ptiſan, that is, the ſecond decoction of huld barly, after the firſt w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>In regard of the quantity for every particular doſe, three ounces, or four ounces wil ſuffice; hence (becauſe Emulſions are for the moſt part prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only for three doſes, for 'twil not be kept longer without corrupting) you may preſcribe 9 ounces, or one pound.</p>
                           <p>Things to be DISSOLVED, in relation to their quality, are ſometimes Sugar alone; or as it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally received, ſome fit Syrup pleaſant to the taſte, that may moiſten, lenifie, and cool, as <hi>Syrup of Violets,</hi> and <hi>Maidenhair.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Sometimes to make it the more pleaſant, there is added ſome Roſe-water.</p>
                           <p>They alſo which diſſolve <hi>Manus Chriſti</hi> made and with Pearls do very wel.</p>

                        <p>As to the USE, DOSE, and <hi>manner</hi> of PRESCRIB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING,
'tis this, ℞ of Aſſes milk, (when you would cool &amp; cleanſe, but Goats milk when you would nouriſh) four ounces; of ſugar or honey (left it corrupt or grow ſowr in the ſtomack,) one ounce, and this for the firſt doſe; for the ſecond doſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing one ounce, to five ounces, ſo proceeding til you come to ten ounces, or twelve ounces, and then decreaſing again by the ſame degrees, til you are returned to the ſame quantity: let it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken 4 hours before meat, neither ſleeping, nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the body violenly after the taking of it.

                        <p>The <hi>WHEY OF MILK</hi> is not nouriſhing, but medicinal, and evacuates both ſerous and aduſt humors: if it be liberally taken it cools, and is good in thoſe that are Feveriſh, and in the heat of the Liver and Reins in ſummer time; but moſt profitable in Melancholy, and affections proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from it, as the Leproſie, Scabbineſs,

                           <hi>BY this name of Diet, we do not ſo much under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the regulating of the ſix things not natural, as divers decoctions made of uſual ſweating Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; through the whole uſe of which, becauſe an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and accurate way of living temperately is to be obſerved, from hence it is that theſe have been abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely called by the name of</hi> Diet.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But that which we underſtand by the name</hi> Diet,
<hi>is a decoction of one of the uſual ſudorifical Medicines, or more, made in a fit Liquor, prepared either to alter ſimply, or evacuate inſenſibly by tranſpiration, or ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by ſweat.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore a Diet-drink is to be accounted two-fold, altering and evacuating.</hi>

                           <p>The MATTER in relation to its quality, is two-fold.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Some of the common Sudorificks, as <hi>Guaia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, China, Saſſafras</hi> and <hi>Salſaparilla.</hi>
                           </p>

                           <p>As to the <hi>quantity;</hi> thoſe ſudorificks in a diet-drink not pectoral are preſcribed either alone, or mixed, to ſix ounces more or leſs, according as the time, age, and region ſhal further require; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, as Roots, Leaves, Seeds, Flowers, either all or ſome of them are to be added to half the <pb n="117" facs="tcp:112514:75"/>quantity they are appointed for the Apozem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid.</p>
                           <p>But in a pectoral <hi>Diet</hi>-drink, whoſe baſis is
<hi>China,</hi> this (if alone) is added to one ounce; if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things aforeſaid be joyned to it, then to two drams, or three drams of theſe, they uſually take ſix drams of <hi>China.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Of alterers pectoral fruits are added to an ounce and a half, or two ounces; pectoral ſeeds to an ounce, or an ounce and a half; and if (as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the <hi>Phthyſis</hi>) the fleſh of Craw-fiſh, or tortoiſes be added, 'tis to an ounce, or two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                           <p>The LIQUOR, in relation to its quality in an altering Diet drink not pectoral, is <hi>common water,</hi> or ſome other <hi>fit liquor,</hi> as before in the Apozem, chiefly <hi>Mead</hi>) becauſe theſe ſorts of decoctions for the moſt part reſpect cold affections, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. In a pectoral Diet-drink alſo, either <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon water,</hi> or
<hi>decoction of Barly</hi> is taken; but with this proviſo, that the
<hi>China</hi> be infuſed in this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor for ſome hours; then let it be put up together with the pectoral fruits and ſeeds in the belly of a chick, or hen; then let them boyl in the aforeſaid Liquor til all be boyled to pieces.</p>
                           <p>As to its quantity, take 10 or 12 pints, or <hi>q. ſ.</hi> as is required to boyl it throughly.</p>
                           <p>Things to be <hi>diſſolved,</hi> as to their quality, in a diet-drink not pectoral, are ſometimes ſyrup, or ſugar, and are preſcribed to be diſſolved together with the aromaticks, as in an altering Apozem.</p>
                           <p>In a pectoral drink ſugar of Roſes is generally preſcribed, yet it may be alſo ſome fit ſyrup.</p>

                           <p>The decoction not pectoral, as to the <hi>manner</hi> indrinking, is to be taken without ſweating.</p>
                           <p>As to the <hi>united quantity,</hi> or doſe, it is to be taken to four ounces, or ſix ounces; as to the divided quantity, it is to be uſed ten or fifteen dayes.</p>

                           <p>And this is the FORM of PRESCRIBING.</p>
                           <p>In a decoction not pectoral, ℞. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> make a deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, keep it in a glazed veſſel for four or five morning doſes, which (the body being firſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged) let him continue for ten or fifteen dayes; in the mean time obſerving a moderate and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diet; and for his ordinary drink, let him uſe the ſecond decoction of the aforeſaid ingredients, which is called a <hi>Bochette.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But in a pectoral one, ℞. (China, or other thing, infuſe them in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of water, then put them in the belly of a chick, together with the fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> boyl it til it be all to pieces, adding at the latter end of the decoction the leaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the preparers) ſtraine all with a gentle preſſure; in one pound of the ſtrained liquor diſſolve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for two doſes, to be given in the morning, keeping his bed two or three hours after, without ſweating; let him continue this fifteen, or 20, or 30 dayes, the body being firſt purged with <hi>Manna,</hi> which is to be repeated once in fifteen dayes: in the mean <pb n="119" facs="tcp:112514:76"/>time living temperatly, and uſing the ſecond decoction of China, or ſmall mead, for his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary drink.</p>
                           <p>The Utility is remarkeable in all long-laſting affections, when your ſcope requires the attenuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reſolving, or otherwiſe inſenſibly conſuming that collection offilthy humors y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> foments this ſort of chronical affections; as alſo to rarifie the wayes and paſſages by which they are to be digeſted, and to prepare them powerfully for expurgation: neither is it ſafe to uſe them with ſweat, as in the
<hi>Aſthma,</hi> and <hi>Phthyſis</hi> eſpecially, in which now a dayes this ſort of diet is onely preſcribed; in which affections 'tis pernitious to uſe either pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or Sudorificks. Neither can we conſume or evacuate thoſe humors that are the fomenters of ſuch affections any other way.</p>

                           <p>But when a bole is made of the drier things, as tablets, and powders, ſo that they can hardly ſtick together in the form of a bole, ℞ <hi>&amp;.</hi> let them be moiſtened with ſuch a ſyrup, then with Sugar reduce them into the form of a bole, which let him take <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but when the bole is made of <hi>Turpentine,</hi> ℞ <hi>Turpentine</hi> waſhed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> make a bole, let each bit be wrapped in Wafers, ſo take them out of a ſpoon, with a convenient Syrup, as of <hi>Maiden hair, Violets,</hi> &amp;c. let them be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed down in the morning three or four hours before dinner, and that uſually for three dayes together.</p>
                           <p>The UTILITY is the ſame with that of a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>viz.</hi> when the cauſe of the affection is in the inferior region, or the parts adjacent; but a bole of <hi>Caſſia</hi> is particularly profitable in the reins and bladder, in which we ſhould deal ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gently, and onely leniſie.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THe Ancients called thoſe medicines which had in their compoſition either <hi>opium</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther narcoticks by the proper name of opiates, but now adayes we abuſively and improperly call thoſe medicines opiates, which are without <hi>opium,</hi> whether to ſtrengthen, alter, or purge, onely for the conſiſtency wherein they are made, like Treacle, and other Opiates of like ſort.</p>
                        <p>They otherwiſe call them more rightly, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries, which now are in uſe twofold; the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, which is otherwiſe called a tablet, or the ſoft, otherwiſe called an Opiate; both theſe were by the Greeks called antidotes, yet this name ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not to include the purgers, as our appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Opiates.</p>
                        <p>But an Opiate is a medicine of a thicker ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance than a ſyrup, ſcarce running abroad (like that true Opiate treacle) prepared of divers things, mixed in honey or ſyrup, to keep long either to purge, alter, or ſtrengthen.</p>
                        <p>Hence, 'tis twofold, purging, and altering, or corroborating.</p>

                           <p>WHat it is (&amp; its differences) may be ſought in the purging Apozem and potion.</p>
                           <p>Here I ſhall at preſent account it twofold, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſteriall, and officinall.</p>
                           <p>What a Magiſteriall is, ſee in the purging ſyrup.</p>
                           <p>Nevertheleſſe three things are to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the compoſition, uſe, and Utility.</p>
                           <p>As to the COMPOSITION, 'tis prepared, 1. Either of powders onely taken in ſyrup, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or both together.</p>
                           <p>Theſe powders are every where choſen out of purging Simples (and ſometimes may be in uſe the ſpices of purging Electuaries) together with their fit correctors, both Simples, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds, as alſo their directors.</p>
                           <p>As to the <hi>quantity,</hi> theſe ſorts of purging powders ought to be preſcribed, according to the number of doſes for which you deſire or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend your Opiate; as if you deſire an Opiate for ſix times, you muſt preſcribe ſix doſes of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in ſubſtance, adding alſo their correctors; as to the <hi>quantity</hi> of that they are made up withall, they uſually, though ill preſcribe it, <hi>q. ſ.</hi> as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noted in the purging ſyrup; for as it is there ſaid, the quantity of theſe is alſo to be defined, and its proportion ought to be three or four times the weight of the powder, and that expreſſly to be ſet down, that you may be certain of the doſe.</p>
                           <p>Note alſo, that when <hi>Caſſia</hi> or other things which have the conſiſtency of hony, are added, they are to be accounted inſtead of ſo much hony.</p>

                           <p>To an ounce of opiate you may adde a dram or two drams at moſt of a purging powder.</p>
                           <p>But for the moſt part, four ounces of theſe ſorts of Opiates are required, and then the doſe of the ſyrup is not defined, for there is need but of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little.</p>

                           <p>As to the <hi>quantity,</hi> that is to be defined by the long continuance of the uſe of it, and the bigneſs of the part to be fomented: ſo for the eye 4 ounces wil ſuffice; for the ſtomack one pint, or a pint and a half; for the <hi>ſhort rib-region</hi> and belly, as is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in obſtructions three pints.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Compound</hi> is made of the decoction of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kindes of ſimples, parts of plants, and a convenient Liquor, in which we muſt conſider quality, and quantity.</p>

                           <p>As to the <hi>quantity,</hi> it is various according to the diverſity of the parts.

                           <p>Note, that in the fomentation of the belly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhort ribs, 'tis uſually ſaid, let the <hi>ſhort-rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>region</hi> be fomented in the morning, 2 or 3 hours before dinner, or elſe before ſupper for three or four dayes, changing often the fomentation, leſt it cool too much: and it is uſually preſcribed after the fomentation to be anointed with ſuch an oyl, liniment, or unguent hot.

                           <p>Is COMPOVNDED, of a fit liquor, in which together with honey, ſugar, and oyl are diſſolved divers purgers; and therefore ſo many things are to be conſidered in the compoſition, but chiefly two; the
<hi>liquor</hi> of which tis made, and the things to be diſſolved in it.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Liquor</hi> as to its <hi>quality</hi> is either the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon decoction for Cliſters uſual in the ſhops, or a
<hi>Magiſterial</hi> decoction preſcribed, according to the urgent occaſion and intention of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, of convenient things: and is either <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering</hi> or <hi>Purging.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Altering which is moſt uſual, is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of fit mollifying things, heating or cooling, according to the intention, of roots, leaves, ſeeds, fruits, flowers, neer this proportion, as of roots, two or three ounces, leaves four handfuls, ſeeds ſix drams, or one oune, or an ounce and a half at moſt, fruits pa. eight, flowers pugil. three.</p>
                           <pb n="268" facs="tcp:112514:151"/>
                           <p>If you would make it purgative, you may do it by adding for phlegme, of <hi>Carthamus</hi> ſeed brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed 6 drams, or one ounce, Agarick tied up like a node in a ragg, 3 drams, <hi>Elect-Turbith</hi> 2 drams, for Melancholy 1 ounce, or 6 drams of <hi>Senna,</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipody an ounce, which is very rare, all which are to be added after the roots, and are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to be boyled after the ſeeds alſo; all theſe are boyled in a convenient liquor, or in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter only. (But this is rare to boyl in purgers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe purgers are afterwards diſſolved in it, which wil be ſufficient.)</p>
                           <p>As to the <hi>quantity</hi> of the <hi>Liquor,</hi> it varies accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the age of the party very much; for 3 oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wil ſerve for a child of 4 or 5 moneths old; if one bigger, 5 or 6 drams; for people of ripe age uſually <hi>lib.</hi> 1. for great men <hi>lib.</hi> one and a half.</p>
                           <p>But here we muſt obſerve in them which are with child, or Hydropical, troubled with wind, and in old Folks we ſhould rather take leſſe, ſo that the whole Clyſter exceed not 12 ounces; alſo when we would have it kept long in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
                           <p>The things to be DISSOLVED, in relation to their quality, are either alterers or purgers; the Alterers which are generally diſſolved, are <hi>Honey</hi> and <hi>Sugar,</hi> and alwayes <hi>oyl,</hi> yet it may be left out when the expulſive faculty is to be ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoked, or where we would draw powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. To theſe are ſometimes added <hi>Salt,</hi> uſually <hi>ſal gem.</hi> where it ſhould be more provokative, as in ſleepy affections.</p>
                           <p>But the purgers are officinal electuaries, either onely lenifying or purging, according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety <pb n="269" facs="tcp:112514:151"/>of the humor to be purged, and the diverſe conſtitution of the body.</p>
                           <p>Sometimes inſtead of them are diſſolved pills in the drowſie affections.</p>
                           <p>As to the <hi>quantity, Honey</hi> and <hi>Sugar</hi> are diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to two or 3 ounces at moſt; in them of ripe age, in children a fourth part wil ſuffice, and leſs in infants. Oyl, in thoſe ripe of age 3 ounces, ſalt to half a dram, or a dram. Electuaries to double the doſe in which they are given by the mouth; but uſually they are proportion'd to an ounce and a half, unleſs they are very gentle, or you would have it work very ſtrongly, then you may add 2 ounces; in Infants you may preſcribe a quarter of that proportion; but if you preſcribe pils (which is ſeldom) do it to two or three drams.</p>

                  <p>AS an Artificer can bring nothing to perfection being deſtitute of a fit matter to workon, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be skilful in the manner of effecting: ſo a Phyſitian can do nothing for the health of the ſick Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, nor preſcribe any forms without a plenteous fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of Medicaments fit for this purpoſe, though he be never ſo wel skill'd in the way of compounding them. Hence appears the neceſſity and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tility of the Phyſical Matter, of which you may find plenty in this enſuing ſyſteme, taken out of divers parts of Plants, (viz. Roots, Barks, VVoods, Leaves, flowers, Seeds, Fruits, Spices,) and humors of them, (viz. Juyces, Raiſins, Gums;) Alſo out of living creatures whole, as wel as the parts &amp; humors of them (Fatts, Suets, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows;) as alſo out of their excrements; as alſo out of things growing bothin ſea &amp; land, as metalline things earths, divers ſerts of ſtones, and things belonging to the ſea: alſocompound things of the ſhops contracted together, and digeſted into certain claſſes, according to the ſeries of directions for curing. So that from hence as out of a moſt plentiful Magazeene, and a moſt ſubtil matrix, (having the method of Phyſick for your guide) a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous ſtore of Remedies may be had in readineſs; ſo make that Polydaedalian heap of compound Medicines. You therefore ye diſciples of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>THE PROOEMIUM, OR PROLOGVE <hi>Concerning the Name, Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and diſtribution of the</hi> Materia Medica, <hi>or matter of PHYSICK:</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe word <hi>Matter of Phyſick</hi> is an ambiguous terme, ſignifying chiefly two things, 1. The ſubject of Phyſick, or the Matter on which the Phyſitian works, and this is the <hi>Paſ. five matter.</hi> 2. The <hi>Active matter,</hi> which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends under it the inſtruments of healing that are in being ſeparate from the underſtanding; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the natural things, or the Matter of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal helps: which matter <hi>I</hi> ſhal rightly with <hi>Galen,</hi> 1. <hi>Alim. fac. chap.</hi> 1, diſtinguiſh from the help or remedy it ſelf, which is the image or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the aforeſaid matter remaining in the mind of the Phyſitian, repreſenting the very ſame thing to the life. In this latter ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication 'tis uſed <hi>either generally,</hi> for all things y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> may be inſtruments of health, with which it is preſerved or reſtored; whoſe engines are three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, Aliments or Food, Medicine, and manual o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations;
<hi>or more ſpecially,</hi> becauſe the cure of diſeaſes is moſt uſually perfected by the help of <pb n="285" facs="tcp:112514:159"/>Medicaments, therefore Phyſitians by the name of <hi>Matter</hi> of Phyſick underſtand the whole ſeries of medicinal things, either ſimple or compound; thus much briefly for the name.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the <hi>Medicinal Matter,</hi> or matter of Phyſick is the orderly ſeries of Medicaments ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or compound, fitted to the method of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and to the preſcribing forms of Medicines.</p>
                  <p>As to the diſtribution of this Phyſical Matter, I firſt diſtinguiſh it thus; either it is <hi>uniuerſal,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting no certain part, or <hi>particular,</hi> regarding ſome certain part; or affection of the body.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> is ſubdivided into 3 other parts; the <hi>firſt</hi> reſpects the Morbifical cauſe where ever it be; the
<hi>ſecond</hi> the chief heads of diſeaſes; the <hi>third</hi> the common ſymptomes, and thoſe that are moſt urgent, which require ſometimes the help of the Phyſitian, diſtinct from that of the cauſe, or the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Particular</hi> ſhall conſiſt of four
<hi>Sections;</hi> the 1. Of the remedies belonging to the Head. 2. Of remedies for the Breaſt. 3. Of remedies belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the belly, or inferior cavity.
4. Of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the limbs.</p>

                           <p>Theſe are thoſe Medicines which attenuate, and ſeparate thick and compacted humors, that in the ſame weight they extend to fill a greater ſpace; theſe in general ſhould be all of them of thin ſubſtance, that they might thereby the eaſier penetrate, and mix themſelves with the ſubſtance of the humour.</p>

                           <p>The uſe of theſe is as wel internal, to open divers obſtructions of the bowels, to purge phlegm out of the breaſt, provoke the courſes, break the ſtone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo <hi>external</hi> to melt cold humors impacted in the skin by their heat, and to make them ſeparable, and extenuate them by its drineſſe and thinneſs of ſubſtance, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards either of their own accord, or by the uſe of diſcuſſing or attracting Medicines they may be wholly diſſipated.</p>

And Openers, alſo <hi>Ecphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticks,</hi> or unſtoppers, becauſe they open the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and free them from obſtructions. Neither do they in ſubſtance differ from Preparers of the humours, but only in the ſubject they work on; for ſometimes it happens that humours y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are not crude, or are already prepared, cannot be expeld becauſe other groſſe humours are in the way, ſtopping the paſſages, by which the peccant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is to paſſe; hence appears the neceſſity of this preparation; which <hi>Galen</hi> 1 <hi>Aph.

                           <p>PUrging Medicines are ſo called, either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly or improperly; theſe are called <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>. <hi>Lenientia,</hi> Lenitives, the others ſpecially Catharticks. The Lenitives are of a four-fold difference; ſome looſen the belly by making it ſlippery, as whatſoever by its own fat moiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubſtance doth ſmooth the inſide of the guts, which otherwiſe is perhaps dryer and rougher then it ſhould be, ſo that by this meanes the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements cannot ſtick to them; ſuch are <hi>oyl of ſweet Almonds, Butter, fat broth of fleſh.</hi> Others are called
<hi>Waſhers,</hi> or <hi>Cleanſers,</hi> which by their abundance of moiſture diſſolve the dung, and cleanſe the internal ſuperficies of the intrals; ſuch are <hi>fair water, Whey, Milk, Beets, Pellitory of the wal, Coleworts, Spinach,</hi> and the broths of theſe. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may be termed
<hi>Compreſſers,</hi> which by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting together the intrals, preſſe forth that which is below them, and by this reaſon
<hi>Quinces</hi> taken laſt at meat looſen the belly; ſo alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanſed Wines, and things very ſowr purge ſome folks, which can be by no other quality then their binding faculty. Laſtly, others are Fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which ſtir up the expulſive faculty by their biting quality, of which ſort are all hot and ſharp things, and beſides, they are of thin parts, and ſome of them ſalt. And in this manner a certain Carter cured diverſe people troubled with a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Fever by giving them a draught of wine,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:112514:172"/>in which was diſſolved a handful of Salt: for they which took it were immediately purged both by vomit and ſtool very violently. In this manner alſo meats much ſalted or aromatized, looſen the belly by ſtimulating nature; and by the ſame reaſon alſo happen thoſe purgings which ſometimes nature moves of her ſelf; alſo thoſe things which purge being applyed to the Navil: as the Ointment of Sowbread commonly called

Medic. c. de aloe.) will have it, but from its native place, viz. the Iſland <hi>Succotra.</hi> Therefore ſome make the Succotrine a particular difference of it ſelfe, diſtinct from the hepatick, but they differ only in the degree of goodneſſe.</p>

<hi>Aloes</hi> are taken from the ſubſtance, weight, colour, ſmell, taſt, in all which ſeverally ſome conditions are to be required; the ſubſtance of it ought to be ſolid and firme as the liver is, yet eaſy to be broken or melted, if it be put into water, not ſandy, but fatty and ſmooth; in weight it ſhould be light; and by how much the lighter, ſo much the better it is; for the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſheweth that ſand is not mixed with it; of colour it ſhould be browne, ſomewhat yellowiſh and rediſh, alſo ſomething tranſparent; for that which is thick and dark is older then the reſt; the ſmell ſhould be good, inclining a little to the ſent of myrrh; the taſt according to <hi>Galen,</hi> ſhould be ſomewhat aſtringent, but extreamly bitter.</p>

There is alſo made a pleaſant electuary of the jelly of apples to twice the weight of the ſugar, to which boyled up to a juſt conſiſtence, there is added the infuſion of Scammony in this proportion, that ℥ i. of the electuary may receive <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> i. of the infuſion, then boyling it up to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, and make an electuary like clear Marme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade; the doſe is <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> iii.

                        <p>THey are ſo called, which by their extreame heat, do burn the skin to divers purpoſes, no leſſe then fire or ſcalding water, and therefore it is neceſſary that they be of a fiery nature; yet they differ both in degrees of heat, and manner of their matter. Of the firſt rank are the rubifiers, and bliſterers, which are the gentleſt of all, of which is ſpoken before; of the ſecond rank are the Cathereticks or corroſive medicines, eating and conſuming, oppoſite to the ſarcoticks, yet theſe only work on the ſuperficies, (without cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the adjacent parts) and corrode, extenuate, conſume and weare away that very gently. They are hot and dry in the third and fourth degree, and of thin ſubſtance, that they may inſinuate into the matter that is to be taken away, and be diſſipated or made invalid before they penetrate far; Of the third ſort are thoſe called Septicks or putrifiers, ſharper then the Cathereticks, penetrate deeper, and diſſolve, putrifie, and corrupt the thinner part of the fleſh, and this they do, not ſo much by the benefit of the intenſeneſſe of their heat, as by a <pb n="397" facs="tcp:112514:215"/>malignant quality, wherefore they are moſt irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to nature, and deſtroy the ſabrick of it, and therefore there followes them the diſſolution of the radicall moyſture, and a carcaſe like putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; they are of much a groſſer ſubſtance then the former, (but moderatly, for they are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of thin parts) for that which is too thin is eaſily diſſipated by our heat; Of the fourth ſort are thoſe which burne to a cruſt, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Eſcaroticks,</hi> or potentiall Cauſticks, (though ſome make an other diſtinction between Eſcaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Cauſticks, and induce the firſt as the milder, the other as the more forcible) which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate deeply, and do not only burn the cuticle, but the whole skin, like fire, and that ſuddainly, cauſing a very hard cruſt, which they uſually call an Eſchare; They are moſt hot in the fourth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, of ſubſtance abſolutely groſſe and earthy, for which reaſon their extreame heat is not eaſily diſſipated, but holding firme together, burns and gnawes violently. The uſe of the Cathereticks is in the excreſcence of fleſh, affections ariſing from proud fleſh, as in the hyperſarcoſis of wounds, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipus of the noſtrils, caruncles, warts and other hardneſſes that are to be taken away. The uſe of the Septicks is alſo in taking away divers tumors, Polipus, ozenas, (ulcers of the noſtrils) hard ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcences, putrid, eating and malignant Ulcers, and corrupted parts of the body; but theſe becauſe they leave behind them an incorrigible inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency, ſhould be quite driven out of chyrurgical uſe, and inſtead of them, if need were, may be uſed cleanſers, cathereticks, and eſcareticks. The uſe <pb n="398" facs="tcp:112514:216"/>of Eſcareticks and Cauſticks is when the skin for ſome cauſe or other is to be opened, and the ſick cannot well endure the opening of it by ſection, or burning, then are we forced to uſe Cauſticks; alſo when we would ſuppreſſe blood, breaking forth from ſome corroſion of the veines, we are faine to cauſe a cruſt or eſcare to cover the part from whence the blood breaks forth; to theſe py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roticks may be numbred the Pſylotres, or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines that take away haire, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as make the part they are applyed to bald, for theſe have alſo a corroding and burning quality.</p>
